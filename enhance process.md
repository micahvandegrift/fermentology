Process for enhancing a talk in Fermentology PubPub
===

TEXT
---
- edit the text/transcript to make it less talky, more read-y without changing the gist of it
- add headings/subheads as makes sense- add block quotes as makes sense (maybe just 1-2 per talk). 
- link to external research or resources mentioned using pubpub's citations feature. Should be at least one link per paragraph. Attempt to always link to open access resources. 

IMAGES
---
- identify several places where an image might be useful. Decide if that should be a photo, data viz, table, etc.
- source images primarily from: Europeana, DPLA, (Getty)[http://portal.getty.edu/] NC State digital archives, wikimedia, Flickr (triple check copyrights before using). If there is a data viz to create, check with Micah to see if DVS can work on it. 
- embed imagery using Storiiies, KnightLabs tools, native viewer embed code from Internet Archive, or directly in PubPub.

COMMENTARY
---
- Using PubPub's features (footnotes, discussion/annotations) add a new layer of commentary to the text. This is where we can pull in other scholarly public resources, natgeo, NYT, Discovery channel, wikimedia/pedia/data, etc. etc.
- Where possible link back to the speakers research (papers, website)
