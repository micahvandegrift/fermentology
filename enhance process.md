Process for enhancing a talk in Fermentology PubPub
===
BEFORE PUBPUB
---
- transcripts come from 3Play Media → 3 versions are created (Plain txt file, Html, Srt with time encoded/encrypted for Youtube) but we use the txt file for now
- transcripts go in Google Drive Folder: Materials for PubPub

IN THE PUBPUB
---
- Click: Create a Pub 
- Click (+): Add to Collection
- Select: Book
- Add Title: “Chapter #: __________________”
- Chapter Title comes from Fermentology Mini-Seminar titles
- Description comes from Fermentology Mini-Seminar titles (max 280 characters)
- Add Contributor → name of Mini-Seminar leader
- Add Affiliation from Mini-Seminar Page
- Upload Transcript txt file: Copy and Paste
- In Pub Settings, 1) add the date of Mini-Seminar Talk, 2) add a Preview Image, 3) create a connection (found on the lefthand bar) to the original Mini-Seminar talk (select Supplement and switch the direction)

TEXT
---
- at the top of the pubpub, add the following editors note (italicized): Editors note: This is a lightly edited transcript of the lecture given as part of the Fermentology webinar series. The talk has been enhanced and enriched with media, annotations, and links to other material by the digital publication team in order to amplify and expand the content of the talk.
- edit the text/transcript to make it less talky, more read-y without changing the gist of it (this may take approx. an hour)
- refer to the prexisting Fermentology Enhanced Talks as models 
- re-read the transcript 2-3 times and make edits as you go (this can be done as you work on adding images/media)
- add bullet-points and lists as needed for clarity 
- as you work through the text, use the discussion/comment feature in Pubpub to make notations about where media could/should be added or referenced
- add headings/subheads as makes sense- add block quotes as makes sense (sim for 1-2 per talk, not more than 3). 
- link to external research or resources mentioned using pubpub's citations feature, hyperlinks, or footnotes. Should be at least one link per paragraph. Attempt to always link to open access resources. With footnotes and citations, be sure to not highlight a phrase or word, but rather place them at the end of a phrase or word as you can accidentally delete things.

IMAGES
---
- identify several places where an image might be useful. Decide if that should be a photo, data viz, table, youtube video, podcast, maps, Tweets, etc. 
- try to break up long sections of text with an image or piece of media (aim for a piece of media every 2-3 paragraphs)
- try to differentiate your media - try to avoid using exlcusively static images/photos only
- for one image: try to use an interactive display if possible
- for two + images: use a gallery-style display  
- for all media: include citation/attribution in caption 
- source images primarily from: LOC, Europeana, DPLA, NC State digital archives, wikimedia, Flickr (triple check copyrights before using). If there is a data viz to create, check with Micah to see if DVS can work on it. 
- embed imagery using Storiiies, KnightLabs tools, native viewer embed code from Internet Archive, or directly in PubPub. 

COMMENTARY
---
- Using PubPub's features (footnotes, discussion/annotations) add a new layer of commentary to the text. This is where we can pull in other scholarly public resources, natgeo, NYT, Discovery channel, wikimedia/pedia/data, etc. etc. (this may take approx. an hour)
- Where possible link back to the speakers research (papers, website)
