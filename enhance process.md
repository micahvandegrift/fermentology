Process for enhancing a talk in Fermentology PubPub
===

TEXT
---
- edit the text/transcript to make it less talky, more read-y without changing the gist of it [DONE]
- add headings/subheads as makes sense- add block quotes as makes sense (maybe just 1-2 per talk). [DONE]
- link to external research or resources mentioned using pubpub's citations feature. Should be at least one link per paragraph. Attempt to always link to open access resources. [NEED HELP WITH THIS] 

IMAGES
---
- identify several places where an image might be useful. Decide if that should be a photo, data viz, table, etc. [DONE]
- source images primarily from: Europeana, DPLA, NC State digital archives, wikimedia, Flickr (triple check copyrights before using). If there is a data viz to create, check with Micah to see if DVS can work on it. [DONE]
- embed imagery using Storiiies, KnightLabs tools, native viewer embed code from Internet Archive, or directly in PubPub. [DONE]

COMMENTARY
---
- Using PubPub's features (footnotes, discussion/annotations) add a new layer of commentary to the text. This is where we can pull in other scholarly public resources, natgeo, NYT, Discovery channel, wikimedia/pedia/data, etc. etc. [DONE]
- Where possible link back to the speakers research (papers, website) [I THINK DONE??]

WORK FLOW: Kelsey Dufresne 

The following outlines my work process - it is not linear, and as the following dmeonstrates, I populated Text, Images, and Commentary sometimes simultaneously. 
===
On TEXT: 
1. Because I had worked previously on Fermentology with the Bee Bread piece, I had familiarity with PubPub, as well as what we were trying to accomplish with these pages and corresponding transcripts. Following Micah's advice, I used the Bee Bread piece as a model for Wild Sourdough.
2. I read through the document, editing it to be more readable and to reflect written conventions (like correct capitalization, italics, etc.). I also made comments in PubPub about where I could/should add media and links to materials referenced in the talk (like maps and Facebook groups). I spent an hour doing this preliminary/inital read through.
3. Began finding links per paragraph. I found the citation feature confusing -- now aiming to save this for the end.

On IMGAES:
4. As I started to add in links to materials referenced in the talk, I realized that the Rob Dunn Lab has a really really really great website that actually compiles all their materials and resources. So, now the challenge is to not be repetitive. 
5. Is it erronous to assume that I can use the images and materials from the Wild Sourdough Project page??
6. Another hour spent on adding links and media.
7. A new day: Following feedback from Micah, I began working to make the enhanced talk more academic-y. Also - got excited by an idea to create a dog visualization. Another hour on re-reading and editing and re-wording for audience. 
8. Still worried about the citation feature because when I first tried it I accidentally deleted text and could not find an UNDO button. 

On COMMENTARY:
10. Now working on adding extra cool stuff - like National Geo stuff (also, personally excited because I enjoy making sourdough and my starter is from the 1800s and Canada) 
11. Okay - immediately confused on trying to find discussion/annotation feature. Is that just the comments? Going to focus on footnotes.... 
12. I feel very lucky because the Wild Sourdough Project team has already created a TON of awesome visuals and media to include.
13. It is increasingly feeling like a fun game tracking down cool links and tangental media to bring in. Rob Dunn is mentioned across the internet - so it is fun finding Dunn Lab mentioned in Nat Geo and NPR and linking those articles.
14. It is also fun trying to find different media. With Bee Bread, I really focused on visual media - and interactive visual media. Now I am trying to find audio (podcasts and NPR talks) and Tweets.
15. Okay - now I think I have TOO MUCH media.
