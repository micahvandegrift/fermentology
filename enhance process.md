Process for enhancing a talk in Fermentology PubPub
===

TEXT
---
- edit the text/transcript to make it less talky, more read-y without changing the gist of it
- add headings/subheads as makes sense- add block quotes as makes sense (maybe just 1-2 per talk). 
- link to external research or resources mentioned using pubpub's citations feature. Should be at least one link per paragraph. Attempt to always link to open access resources. 

IMAGES
---
- identify several places where an image might be useful. Decide if that should be a photo, data viz, table, etc.
- source images primarily from: Europeana, DPLA, NC State digital archives, wikimedia, Flickr (triple check copyrights before using). If there is a data viz to create, check with Micah to see if DVS can work on it. 
- embed imagery using Storiiies, KnightLabs tools, native viewer embed code from Internet Archive, or directly in PubPub.

COMMENTARY
---
- Using PubPub's features (footnotes, discussion/annotations) add a new layer of commentary to the text. This is where we can pull in other scholarly public resources, natgeo, NYT, Discovery channel, wikimedia/pedia/data, etc. etc.
- Where possible link back to the speakers research (papers, website)

WORK FLOW: Kelsey Dufresne 
On TEXT: Because I had worked previously on Fermentology with the Bee Bread piece, I had familiarity with PubPub, as well as what we were trying to accomplish with these pages and corresponding transcripts. Following Micah's advice, I used the Bee Bread piece as a model for Wild Sourdough.

Process:
1. I read through the document, editing it to be more readable and to reflect written conventions (like correct capitalization, italics, etc.). I also made comments in PubPub about where I could/should add media and links to materials referenced in the talk (like maps and Facebook groups). I spent an hour doing this preliminary/inital read through.
2. Began finding links per paragraph. I found the citation feature confusing -- now aiming to save this for the end.
3. As I started to add in links to materials referenced in the talk, I realized that the Rob Dunn Lab has a really really really great website that actually compiles all their materials and resources. So, now the challenge is to not be repetitive. 
4. Is it erronous to assume that I can use the images and materials from the Wild Sourdough Project page??
5. Another hour spent on adding links and media.
